# 🚢 Logistic Regression — Titanic Survival Prediction

This project demonstrates how to build a **Logistic Regression Classification Model** using the classic **Titanic dataset**.  
The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on attributes like age, sex, class, and fare.  

🎯 Objective
Predict "survival outcome (0 = Not Survived, 1 = Survived)" using passenger and travel features.

🧰 Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Joblib (for model saving)

🧩 Project Workflow

1. Data Loading
Loaded `Titanic_train.csv` and `Titanic_test.csv` datasets and combined them for consistent preprocessing.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Checked missing values and summary statistics  
- Visualized survival distribution by "Gender" and "Passenger Class"  
- Explored distributions of "Age" and "Fare"  

3. Data Preprocessing
- Imputed missing values using median/mode  
- Encoded categorical features (`Sex`, `Embarked`, `Pclass`)  
- Scaled numerical features using "StandardScaler"
